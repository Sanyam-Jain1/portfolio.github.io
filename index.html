                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>Hey, I am <b>Harry Potter</b>, a 20 year old student studying computer science at <em>University Of
                        California, Berkeley(UCB).</em> I am a full stack developer and Programmer. I am very much
                    interested in
                    computer science and artificial intelligence(AI). I am also deeply interested in logic science and
                    mathematics.I have begun to explore the social implications of science and technology in civic life.
                    <br><br>I have always had an innate zeal for taking part in coding contests and competitions and
                    subsequently, have also brought laurels for my high school in the same. These competitions have
                    provided
                    me
                    with a more holistic idea about the realm of coding and also helped me further hone my coding
                    proficiency. A
                    fervent desire to work has made me the President of TECHO, the Computer Club of XYZ Public School,
                    New
                    Delhi. President I.T. in the Student Council and a member of various other co-curricular clubs in my
                    high
                    school.</p>

                <p><b>Facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly</b><br><br> Human face is an
                    important part of an individual’s body and plays a significant role in knowing a
                    person’s state of mind. This eliminates the dreary and tedious task of manually isolating or
                    grouping songs into various records and helps in generating an appropriate playlist based on an
                    individual’s emotional features.
                    One can create an application
                    to
                    suggest songs for users based on their mood by capturing facial expressions.<br><a
